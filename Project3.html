        <h4 class="introduction">For a college kid who relied on babysitting money, it seemed like a pretty nice gig.</h4>
        <p>I first heard of multi-level marketing jobs when my mom's friend messaged me on Facebook, asking if I'd like to help her with her small business and "join her team" at a beauty company that I hadn't heard of before. I figured I had nothing to lose -- what could possibly be the harm in helping Heather with her lipstick sales at a wedding vendor show? But once I was there, something seemed off. The beauty products themselves felt cheap and Heather wanted me to purchase $1000 worth of inventory to "help her help me." <br>
            
            <br> I decided to stick to babysitting and barista-ing, and I'm glad I did.</p>
        <h2>Multi-Level Marketing and Direct Sales</h2>
        <p>I later found out that the company Heather worked for, LipSense, was a multi-level marketing organization or MLM. According to the Federal Trade Commission, employees of MLMs sell products to family and friends, while also recruiting others to do so. Oftentimes they can be compared to "pyramid schemes" and sometimes the two overlap. As the FTC explains, in pyramid scheme organizations, there are often extravagant promises of high earning potential, but these earnings are increased through recruiting new members rather than actually selling products. "Distributors," the employees or sales representatives, will often buy more products than they can sell, just to meet certain bonus targets to remain "active" members of the company. Oftentimes, higher ups in the company will use emotional tactics to keep distributors on board and buying product, increasing their group's profit total. <br>
   <br> In 2018, AARP surveyed participants in multi-level marketing companies, to establish a database of outcomes. It found that despite the popularity of the direct sales format, only one in four individuals who participated in a MLM had actually made a profit. Additionally, results showed that MLMs didn't yield the results participants expected. </p>

    <p>MLMs are required to provide income disclosure statements that show how much their distributors are making annually. However, data suggests that these might not paint an accurate picture of the money-making model. Lularoe, an MLM known for selling leggings with patterns from florals to cactuses in Santa hats, showed that in 2021, 51% of active members profited between $1 and $5000. However, the data mentions later on in the statement that these profits don't include any of the startup or ongoing costs distributors pay out of pocket. Additionally, just under 1/5 of distributors profited less than $0 in 2021, even before additional distributor expenses. <br>  </p>
  
<br> Since 2017, Lularoe has been hit with several lawsuits alleging that the company is a pyramid scheme <br>

        <h2>Bankruptcy</h2>
        <p>Data from AARP also showed that individuals involved in MLMs declare bankruptcy at a higher rate than non-participants.</p>
