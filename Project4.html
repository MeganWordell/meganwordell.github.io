        <h4 class="introduction">New York City is often deemed a concrete jungle (where dreams are made of)</h4>
        <p> But Alicia Keys failed to mention the rich forestry the city has to offer. According to the NYC parks department, 1/5 of the city's land area is covered in trees, with around 5.2 million growing on public and private property <br>
            
            <br> These trees play a crucial part in not only maintaining and upholding the city's biodiversity. The city notes that their presence helps to slow global climate change, improve air quality for residents, and lower average air temperatures in the summer. </p>

            <br> But with all the benefits of growing tree populations in NYC, come key inequalities, as not all neighborhoods are planned to reap the same benefits. </p>
        
          
        <p>The 1960s and 70s saw a growth in the "radical gardening" movement throught out the NYC metropolitan era. Vox reported that before this time period, white flight and economic dis-investment left the city without greenspaces, and those who remained, took to planting on their own. <br>
   <br> A resident of the Bedford Stuyvessant neighborhood of Brooklyn, Hattie Carthan, noticed the lack of trees in her neighborhood. Bed Stuy had recently been facing the effects of red lining, which Vox said created multiple intolerable life conditions.  Carthan and others in her neighborhood organized a "tree matching" program where the city would donate six trees for every four planted. This effort led to approximately 1,500 trees planted in Bed-Stuy during the time period.

   Despite the efforts of gardeners during this time period, several areas of Brooklyn still have fewer trees per acre than other neighborhoods </p>

    <p>Seagate and Gravesend in particular had the fewest trees per acre, according the the New York City tree census in 2015. The tree census is done once a decade and ascesses different environmental factors of the area including tree type, age, and specific geographic location. <br>  </p>
  
<br> The National Library of Medicine did a study in the early 2000s showing how trees impact health outcome. Researchers concluded that individuals, namely children, living in areas with more trees on the street experienced lower rates of asthma. While asthma obviously isn't caused by a lack of trees alone, and proximity to pollution sites plays a huge factor, the study showed that tree density was high in areas with low rates of asthma and vice versa. <br>
